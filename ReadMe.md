### Repository

This repository is an open source project - EasyEPLANner.
We are working on the project and solving various issues related to the development and project life.

### EPLAN

[EPLAN Electric P8](https://www.eplan-software.com/solutions/eplan-electric-p8/) is a modular and scalable solution for electrical design, automatic design and working documentation.

[EPLAN API Help](https://www.eplan.help/en-us/Infoportal/Content/api/2023/index.html) - Description and examples of how to use the EPLAN API.

Examples for EPLAN Electric P8 automation in the C# programming language can be found at

### EasyEPLANner

<img src="docs/user_manual/images/EasyEplannerPreview.png">

The EasyEPLANner is being developed as an Add-In to EPLAN 2.9 version. The add-in is being used for EPLAN projects and helps you to reduce the work of an Automation engineer and a Software engineer as well.

Software engineer creates code in Lua programming language for the project. EasyEPLANner helps you to describe technological objects (Tank, Boiler, etc.), operations of these objects, steps of operations, restrictions for operations, and many other properties. Eventually, EasyEPLANner generates LUA files that are going to be uploaded to a controller. We support controllers from the following manufacturers:

1. [Phoenix Contact - PLCNext](https://github.com/plcnext);
2. [WAGO - PFC200](https://github.com/WAGO).

### How to build
You could clone repository by next command:  
`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/savushkin-r-d/EasyEPLANner.git`

or, if you are cloned without initializing and updating submodules, try next:  
`git submodule update --init --recursive`

Congratulations, now you can build our solution (_if you have a EPLAN P8 app_).
